# Equipment Management

all good books start with a quote. all good quotes have a story. all good stories belong in books.

## Chapter 1 - Equipment Manager

Fred was nervous. As the shop foreman for Jimmy Smith & Sons, he had only really talked to Jimmy once, not counting the "how-are-yous" in the hallway. Jimmy, the CEO and founder of the company, was known for his loud voice, instant decisions, and commanding presence. He had grown the company from a single rented excavator in 2001 to an indebted behemoth in 2008, watched the company nearly die during the subsequent crash, and rebuilt it again back to more than triple the size.

Jimmy was a kind man, James had heard. It wasn't likely that he was going to be fired, but still.

"Fred!" Jimmy's voice boomed out from the office door before Fred had even reached it. "Come in!"

Fred paused at the door, looking into the executive's office. There were the typical awards on the wall—County's Best Road Project, AGC Project of the Year, Young Construction Professional's Safety Award—and other knickknacks tucked into glass cabinets. Dominating one wall was a stuffed sheep head, curled horn making nearly two complete spirals. 

Jimmy sat behind a large, neat, mahogany desk. A gigantic curved monitor took up one side, and Fred glanced at the mechanical keyboard, with the J, I, M, Y keys in Smith & Sons green. 

"Cherry switches?" Fred knew basically nothing about mechanical keyboards except that his younger brother was always talking about them. 

"Are you talking about my new keyboard?" Jimmy laughed, "I have no idea. It was Todd's present to me. The thing is loud, not sure if I'm going to keep it, but I figure you should never turn down a gift from the IT guy if you ever want his help with the printer ever again."

Todd was hardly "the IT guy." Todd McClean was the new CIO of Smith & Sons, and he had been making the rounds of corporate IT for the last fifteen years, most recently at a big multi-state above-ground general contractor. He was intense and quirky, and since he had joined the company was always the first person at the office and always the last person to leave.

Jimmy motioned to the seat in front of the desk. "Sit down, Fred. I'm glad you're here. How are things?"

Fred hated that question. Should he tell the truth? "Good, thanks," he lied. "It's a beautiful day." His insipid answer made him die just a bit more on the inside. 

"Good, good. Well, I asked to come up to the office to talk to you about the management of the shop. I'm sure you know by now that Neil gave his two-weeks notice yesterday."

-----

Fred did know that, and had actually known it was coming for a few weeks. He had mixed feelings about his boss leaving—on one hand, Neil hadn't managed the growth of the companies fleet very well, and Fred suspected a lot of his long hours were due to Neil's mismanagement and lack of planning. However, he was also a kind and compassionate man, and always had a listening ear for Fred and the other employees in the shop. When Neil had first told the two mechanic foremen about his decision to move on, both of them had thought about following him.

"Neil's leaving the company," Fred told Joan that night over supper. "I dunno what to think."

"Why is he leaving?" Joan asked

"He didn't give us too many details, but I think he's finally had enough of the craziness. His eye's been sure twitching a lot lately. I'm guessing that the shop getting the blame for the dewatering mess down at the interstate was probably the last straw."

Joan knew more about dewatering than 99% of people in the world, thanks to that job and Fred's long nights working swing and graveyard. "I thought you said the dewatering was handled fine in the end. What did it have to do with the shop? You and Kiens busted butt to make the schedule."

"Yeah," Fred sighed, "we did bust butt. And the schedule wasn't impacted by the drill breaking, but we spent something like four times the cost to get the mainline in. The job was already in trouble, and that just made the job go negative. Or that's what the super told me last time I was out there. Neil was _pissed off _when he came back from the postmortem on that job."

Joan knew how big a deal this was for Fred. "Where's Neil going?"

"He won't—or can't—tell us. I'm guessing he's going to the competition, or he'd probably at least tell me and Charles." Charles was the shop mechanic foreman, Fred's peer and good friend.

There was a long pause. 

"Think it's time to quit?" Fred voiced what he was really wondering. Joan had always been his best friend and confidant, and he knew she would give him an honest answer.

"Quit. Huh." Joan was quiet, and she took another bite of stew. After a moment, she said, "What makes you ask that?"

"I dunno, its just the long hours and the constant three-alarm fires are getting me down. And every time I'm on a job with Bob I'm worried I'm going to blow a gasket and lay into him. Besides, it's not like I'm getting better pay then anywhere else. I guess the health insurance is good, but..." he trailed off.

They had discussed the possibility of him leaving long into the night, long after they had put little Freddy Jr. to bed. In the end, Joan had convinced him that he couldn't leave just yet.

"It just seems like there's still work to be done! It'd be nice to leave the company in a better position than when you started, and besides, you have your guys to think about. Give it another year, Fred. We're still young. Anybody can do anything for one year."

So Fred had gone back to the shop, determined to his little part of the world the best it could be. The problem was he had no idea how.

-----

Jimmy continued.

"So Neil was a long-time employee, and I've been proud to have him at our company. Unfortunately, him and I disagreed about a lot of things, and while I'm always sad to see a quality guy go, I think it might be just what the shop needs—fresh blood to really shake things up.

Neil ran things old school, but he never would look at the cost reports that I had accounting run for him. He would never look at a computer period, actually. Still has a flip phone as far as I know. But I'm not here to talk to you about him. What I want to talk to you about is the new shop manager."

Fred leaned forward. "You've hired one?"

"No," said Jimmy, "not yet. We have a guy in mind though. I'd like your thoughts."

"Sure, I'll help any way I can." Fred wasn't sure how much help he could be, but he absolutely had opinions. 

"Take a look at this—page 4" Jimmy tossed a stapled packet at Fred. 

The front of the green packet said **Jimmy Smith & Sons Financial Statements for the Month and Year ending March 2022** in big black letters. Below this ran "For management use only." Fred turned to page 4. 

Page 4 was titled "Income Statement" and had a column that said March, 2022 and YTD, 2022. There was red sharpie around a series of numbers in the YTD column. Fred looked up.

"Uh, stupid question, but, uh... what does 'YTD' stand for?"

"Year to Date." Jimmy answered. "You ever looked at an income statement?"

"Um, kinda. I mean Joan... oh that's my wife—"

"I met her at the Christmas party, I remember her."

"Yeah, she has a coffee shop that does pretty good, I guess. The tax guy gives us a thing he calls a 'profit and loss' every year, but it doesn't look exactly like this."

He looked back down at the green packet in his hand. "So what am I looking at here?"

"The numbers I circled are a major problem for me." Jimmy replied. "Look at them closely and tell me what you see."

Fred looked at the paper:

Equipment Revenue                              3,892,654

Equipment & Vehicle Depreciation:   1,254,000

Parts                                                         1,000,000

Fuel                                                          1,200,000

Repair Labor                                           1,300,000

Shop Mgmt & Admin Labor                    300,000



"Well," Fred said carefully, "it appears that maybe we are spending more money than we're getting for our equipment?"

"Exactly!" Jimmy boomed. "And nobody knows why. I get the feeling that the new IT guy knows more than anybody who's actually touched a piece of yellow iron. Accounting says it's because we can't control costs. Neil said it's because the operators kept abusing the equipment. Bill says it's because Neil can't maintain a good solid push while crapping much less a modern fleet of equipment."

William (Bill) P. Dower, III was the VP of operations, possibly the only person that had a more forceful personality than Jimmy himself. 

Fred was getting more and more confused. "So, did you want my opinion too? or what does this have to do with the new guy you're hiring?"

"It has _everything_ to do with the new manager. I need somebody that will actually get to the bottom of this mess. Look. We made 8 million dollars from our jobs last year, and we spent half of that just on our fleet alone, before even paying for the rest of our overhead. We LOST money as a company last year, and we only kept the trend going the first three months of year. LOST money! Our company has better jobs in a better market than we have _ever _had and we lost money. I think that it's because of the way we run our equipment."

"I'm still not quite sure..."

Jimmy interrupted him. "What does a shop manager need to do to run this show?"

Fred, not sure if Jimmy's question was rhetorical or not, said, "A good manager has to know his people. He's gotta know what they do, and he's gotta make it easy for them to do it. If he actually cares about them, it's a solid plus."

"And?" Jimmy had leaned forward during Fred's spiel. 

"And a good manager runs interference for the team so the management crap doesn't ruin our life." Fred blushed, suddenly aware that the "management crap" he was talking about probably came from the guy he was talking to. He decided to keep going. "And a good manager doesn't bog his people down with needless paperwork, and knows that real work happens when people are moving not sitting in meetings and that if you get people who want to work the best thing you can do is get out of their way."

Jimmy was smiling now. "Well done! it seems like you are an astute learner. You've managed to swallow all the bullshit that Neil preached to you the last... you've worked here, what, 3 years now?"

Fred flushed again. "I _did_ hear most of that from Neil, but it was true! I never saw the point of the meetings, except that we finally got to set down the wrenches, drink some coffee and shoot the breeze. And Neil mighta let things get a little outta control, but we all knew he had our back."

"Ok, ok, great. But what could Neil have _improved? _And he's already on his way out the door, so you don't have to protect him or worry about being a tattle."

Huh. So I'm not going to get thrown out for saying controversial things, Fred thought. "Well, I suppose there were some things. I never really agreed with his ideas of _how_ to cut costs, for example. Plus he was a bit to lax with some of the fellas when they wanted to leave early on Fridays. Kinda pissed me off especially since they were just heading to the bar. I guess maybe there were one or two other things too, but overall I was pretty happy with the way he treated me."

"What else would you have the new manager do that was different than Neil?" Jimmy probed further, making Fred more than a little uncomfortable, like he was ratting out his favorite uncle.

"More than anything, I want to know what's going on, and I think the other guys do too. It's frustrating to be kept in the dark, both about tomorrow's plans and where the company is going. He was privy to all sorts of company meetings and plans and stuff and he never told us squat. And then our plans change every day—I'll have something on the high-lift in the morning and then some other piece will roll up on the lowboy and he'll come running out to swap out the one we're half dug into for the latest emergency. And he always wanted things to go through him to coordinate anything when it would have been faster just to talk to Charles."

"What are a shop manager's responsibilities to the rest of the company?" Jimmy asked.

Fred had never really thought about that before, but he felt like he needed to hazard a guess. "Keep the equipment running, I guess?"

"That's one of them, all right. Keep thinking it over, I want you to come tell me when you think you know. In the meantime, take this home, read it over, and bring it back signed tomorrow."

He pushed a thick piece of paper over the desk at Fred.

At the top it read: 

Dear Fred Gilbronsen,

I'm pleased to offer you the position of Shop Manager. Duties and compensation are below. 

Fred's eyes fixed on the number at the bottom: 25k more per year than he was making now. He looked up at Jimmy, who suddenly looked old and weary. 

"Listen. We either figure this out, or I shut the business down. The last time I lost this much money was in 2008 and 2009, and I won't go through it again. I won't. I think you can do this, Fred—I'm counting on you."

## Chapter 2 - Buddy

Two weeks previously

Buddy sat at his desk, staring listlessly at the Work In Progress schedule on his desk. Buddy was a junior accountant and recently graduated with his bachelor's in accounting from nearby Washington State. It was the 14th of the month, and the "Green Book," that is, the company internal financial statement, was due tomorrow. Buddy had assisted his boss Cathy, Jimmy Smith & Sons Controller, in getting everything posted. For the first time he finally felt like he truly understood how the Work in Progress, or WIP, affected the company's income statement. The Green Book was ready for review, and Cathy had gone home several hours ago.

But Buddy hadn't gone home. He didn't like it. Something was wrong. The jobs were going really well, and when he and Cathy had met with Bill, the VP of Operations, he was as upbeat as Buddy had ever seen him.

"That's some hot stuff there!" Bill had crowed, pointing at the printout. "My guys are killin' it." 

And in fact, they were. Nearly every job was more profitable than it had been when they were bid, and the WIP schedule reflected it. It had been so good that Cathy had decided to "hold some profit back" in case the Bill's project managers were being overly optimistic. 

But even with the jobs doing well, and the uptick in gross margin from that, the company had lost money again. March was another bleeder—not as bad as January and February, but still another red month. Buddy had been through all the numbers, and looked at all the reports again and again. He even dove into Cathy's reconciliation workbook to make sure she hadn't made some kind of mistake. Everything was in order, but there just wasn't enough money to cover all the indirect and overhead costs. He reviewed what he knew about basic accounting, sure he was just missing something stupid.

On the whiteboard, he drew the income statement.

<pic of income statement>

"It just doesn't make sense." Buddy muttered out loud.

"What doesn't make sense?" A voice asked from behind him. 

Buddy jumped and whirled around. "Todd! You scared me! I thought I was the only one here."

"I was just leaving, and saw your light on, thought I'd come check up on you. What doesn't make sense?" 

"Oh, I'm just pounding my head against the financials. I'm guessing I'm just missing something stupid."

"Is this for the Financials meeting tomorrow? I thought Cathy said that everything was complete for that." Todd came to the Financials meeting every month, Buddy knew.

"Well, it _is_ done, it's just... I dunno, wrong somehow. I mean, it's so frustrating, it seems like we should be making money hand over fist. I know it's not really my job to figure out _why, _just report _what_ happened, but I can't help it. I wish I knew what was going on!"

"First, an accountant that only looks in the rear-view mirror is an accountant that isn't worth paying," Todd said firmly. "You've got to help figure out the why or you'll never be more than a spreadsheet monkey. Second, I've seen an income statement or two. Show me the problem."

 Buddy pointed at the Green Book on his desk, open to the income statement. "Look at this. Our gross margin is great—28% year-to-date. That's on revenues of 25 million, 3 million better than this time last year. But even with 7 million dollars to pay our overhead, we STILL lost money! It simply doesn't make sense!"

Todd pointed at the whiteboard. "So you're telling me this number" he tapped the $ sign by the words _Gross Margin_ "is 7 million dollars?"

"Yup," said Buddy. "I mean if you round down a bit."

"What's this number?" Todd tapped the red $ sign by the words _G&A. _

"Our General and Administrative expense was 2,234,000. This is slightly less than it was last year, with the reduction in office headcount that Jimmy instituted last fall." Buddy replied.

"And Sales expense?"

"345,000, which is basically just the salaries of the three estimators." 

"So that leaves Indirect expenses. What was that total?" Todd asked.

"4,372,000. That plus the 50k write-off on that old subdivision job put us in the red." Buddy replied.

Todd leaned over Buddy's desk. "I thought we were budgeting something like 500k per month for Indirects, which would be one and half million so far this year. So we're three times that?"

Buddy pulled up the budget spreadsheet on his screen. "Yeah, you're basically right. We budgeted 625,000 per month for all our Indirects."

Todd circled the desk and stood behind Buddy's chair. "Well, there's the problem then. We budgeted zero dollars for Net Equipment Expense, but..." he bent down to the Green Book again," we spent 2.5 million dollars. Looks like I found our hole. Explain this and you've solved it."

Todd walked to the opening of Buddy's little cubicle. "Seems like Jimmy Smith & Sons has an equipment problem, doesn't it? What do you think we should do about it?"

But before Buddy could answer, Todd waved and walked out.

-----

Buddy looked at his watch, which vibrated softly with a call. It was Ron! He scrambled for his phone and answered:

"Hey, Ron." 

"Hey Buddy," Ron replied. "Where you at?"

"Um... what time is it?" Buddy glanced at his watch again. 1:38 AM. "I... uh... lost track of time. I'm here at the office."

There was silence on the other end of the line.

"I'm nearly done! I think I finally figured it out! You should see this. Bill is all excited because the jobs made more money than they've ever made. They just finished projections today, and all the jobs ticked up—well except the Interstate 5 Overpass Project, which keeps losing money. But it's going to be another loser month, and some proverbial stuff is going to hit some proverbial fans tomorrow."

There was a longer silence.

"Ron, you there?"

Ron coughed, lightly. Ron was Buddy's taciturn uncle, youngest of the 8 kids that made up Buddy's mother's family. Ron was only 24 years old when Buddy's mom and dad died in a car accident, leaving two orphans, Buddy at 8 and Cindy at 6. Ron, single, stable, and quiet, had proposed to adopt them and move into the family's home. He had assumed the mortgage and the job of fatherhood with the same slow quietness that he approached the rest of life. He was thoughtful, earnest, and, at least in Buddy's opinion, wise. 

"Buddy. Wrap it up, man. I'm gettin' worried about you." Ron still looked after Buddy, who had returned home after college. 

"Ok, ok, I'll be there soon. Just go to bed, I promise I won't be much longer. I just gotta get this ready for Cathy to present tomorrow"

"See you soon." Ron hung up.

Buddy returned to the numbers. His desk and floor of his little cubicle was littered with printouts and notes. On his screen was the accounting system, SQL Server and Microsoft Excel. But he had found the source of the issue: The budget assumed all of the equipment expenses were going to be covered by the internal charges to the jobs—and they weren't. Not even close. The Green Book had a single line called "Net Equipment Expense" but that was made up of several "buckets" that were summarized:

Equipment Revenue                              1,487,054

Equipment & Vehicle Depreciation:   1,254,000

Parts                                                         1,000,000

Fuel                                                          1,200,000

Repair Labor                                           1,300,000

__Shop Mgmt & Admin Labor                    300,000__

Net Equipment Expense                        2,497,000



It was right there! The Equipment Revenue was barely enough to cover depreciation, much less the shop costs. Buddy was exultant. Cathy would be able to show this tomorrow, they would change how much they were charging the jobs, and Bill would have to stop crowing about how good his team was.



## Chapter 3 - Shop

"As Polonius said, 'I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to reckon my groans.'" 

Fred stopped and looked up at the serious face of a mechanic peering down at him from the inside of a Cat 745 articulated truck's open engine compartment.

"Something wrong, Greg?" Fred asked.

"Just the code reading from ol' Betty here. She's been good to us, she has, but I'm afraid she's nearing the end of the road. I got a call from Jenny to come get her from Littleton. Jenny's calls are always instructive—I learn new words every time."

Jenny Tomasson was a salty site superintendent that had been with the company some 25 years. She had fought her way up in what she called a "@#$%ing man's world" to be the most respected super at Smith & Sons, and everyone knew she was "good stuff." Laborers fought to be on her jobs, and owners paid extra for her to run their work.

"Why did she call you?" Fred asked. "Why didn't she send a ticket into dispatch?"

Greg climbed down the metal rungs on the side of the haul truck and wiped his hands on a shop rag. "She said, and I quote, 'I actually need it done today so I didn't have time to wait for the ticket system.' Well, that's not a direct quote, but paraphrased so as to remove the invective."

"Uh... 'invective?' Is that a made-up word?" Fred asked.

"Swear. Curse. Abuse. Blaspheme." Greg had a world-weary look. "Invective is highly critical or..."

Fred waved him off, laughing. "I know, I know. Listen, I came out here to find you. I need you to run down to the Overpass Project and diagnose the EC300E. They just called to say they stopped the project 'cuz the hydraulics in the boom quit working. I'm guessing it's that valve again."

"Ah, yes, our lovely Swedish machine, as old as the King himself, but far less reliable. It may be time for the men who wear white shirts to think about replacing her with something from this millennium!" 

Greg wasn't exactly right about that particular excavator being old. It was 8 years old, in fact, and had been bought new by Jimmy Smith himself after a factory tour in Hallsberg, Sweden. But ever since arriving at the company, the 30-ton machine had almost never slowed down. It had 14,000 hours on it, and things were starting to get a little shaky.

 "Yup, that's the one." Fred responded. "Can you please drive down and take a look at it ASAP? I got a call from Johnny directly."

"Why did he call you?" Greg looked at Fred, dead-pan. "Why didn't he send a ticket to dispatch?"

Fred shook his head, not rising to the bait. "Just go down there, and give me a call. I'll make sure we get one of the shop boys to go pick up whatever we need. Take the spare mechanic truck out back."

"I believe that mechanic truck is still up on blocks awaiting new rotors." Greg said.

"What? We were supposed to be done with that two weeks ago! Are the parts delayed?" Fred asked.

"No, the rotors are there, lying on the floor of the cab, I believe. Timmy got pulled off it to look at Bill's truck and then started working on the new undercarriage on the D8."

"Ok, ok, take my truck down there then. We'll have to get one of the field mechanics to come join you. I know they're all busy, so I'm not going to send them until we you know what's going on and we have the parts." Fred shook his head and fished his keys out of his pocket. Greg was a shop mechanic, and didn't have his own truck. He hated sending him out to the field anyway, but at this point he had no other choice. Greg was the best mechanic they had, a true machine-whisperer, and the Volvo was on the largest and most visible project Smith & Sons was working on.

"And what should I do about Jenny?" Greg patted the haul truck behind him. "My instructions from her were quite clear." 

Fred sighed. "I'll call Jenny and tell her what's going on."

Greg saluted. "On my way, boss!" 

As he walked away, Fred could hear him saying, "Theirs not to make reply, theirs not to reason why, theirs but to do and die..." 

Fred sighed again and pulled out his phone to call Jenny.

-----

Fred walked into the dispatch office 15 minutes later, his ears still ringing with Jenny's "invective." 

Howard Smith, Jimmy's youngest boy, was lounging 

## Chapter 4 - Dispatch

Fred trudged across the gravel parking lot, despondent. He was on his way from the main office building to the shop. He had just come out of the Monday morning executive meeting, and once again Bill had been on his case about the state of the equipment on the jobs, and once again blamed the lack of progress on the Interstate project on the machines breaking down. Never mind that there was a standby machine there—"It was busy doing other things" Bill had retorted—and never mind that three mechanics had been sent out, and were able to get the Volvo fixed in record time. 

It was sprinkling in a Pacific Northwest gloomy sort of way. The gravel lot was filled to capacity with pieces of equipment that weren’t in use on the jobs, including a perfectly good Cat 330—exactly the piece that would have kept the Interstate project rolling last week. The sight of all the pieces of equipment not working made him mad, and just added to his general bad humor.

"Fred!" A voice called out from behind him. Fred turned around, and saw Todd running toward him. Todd had been in the meeting this morning, as usual, and as usual had said nothing. His usual was to look at each speaker with intelligent eyes, as if willing them to keep speaking. He also kept notes in a small Moleskine notebook. He was holding this notebook now, heedless of the sprinkling rain. "Fred!" he called again.

Fred turned back and met Todd. "Yeah?"

"Hey, I had a few questions for you about the problems that came up this morning. Got some time before your next thing?

"Sure." Fred replied. "Want to come to my office at the shop?"

"That’ll work." Todd looked around at the equipment as they started walking towards Fred’s office. "What’s all this equipment doing here?"

"Mostly, they’re waiting for a job to go to. That one over there—" Fred pointed at a haul truck, "is ready to head out to <name of female superintendent>’s job. Most of them have nowhere to go, and maybe thirty or forty percent of them are broken down waiting for us to catch up."

"Huh." Todd walked up to a machine and wiped the mud off the equipment number on a paddle wheel scraper. "What do these numbers mean?"

"Oh, and the numbers are just our equipment numbers. We give each piece a number—the first two are the rate category that the piece is in, and the next 3 are just sequential. Scrapers are 45s or 46s depending, and so this one is 46023, meaning it’s the 23rd paddle-wheel we’ve ever owned."

"I see. Who decides who gets what piece?" They were nearing the equipment shop now, and they could hear the ratcheting sound from the air hammer

"Bonzo Smith, Jimmy’s boy, is the head of dispatch—but really it’s the individual supers that decide. They tell Bonzo what they need, and he makes sure they get out to them. They’re supposed to get him the information for next week, but they never seem to know what they need until it’s an emergency. Bonzo figures out the pieces that are available, and tells ‘em when to expect it. The two lowboy drivers report to him, and he’s got Cindy working part time to help him pull trip permits. Bonzo…" Fred trailed off, realizing that he was going to start griping and not sure Todd wanted to hear it.

"Bonzo what?" Todd pressed.

"Bonzo is… uh… not well suited for the role?" 

"Is that a question, or are you unsure if you should be judging him?" Todd asked with a smile.

"Well, I guess Bonzo struggles to keep up with all the requests. Plus he got moved into that role after Bill tried to fire him, and basically I’m not sure if he really wants it." Fred was treading on thin ice here, and decided to change the subject. "Have you been back to the shop since you started?"

"Nope, or rather just the once when I went on the ‘orientation tour’ with all the other new hires. They showed us the shop from the outside."

"Well, let me give you a brief tour from somebody who knows what’s going on!" Fred was glad to get in out of the rain as he stepped into the main bay. "The shop is actually the largest building on our site, and it’s made up of five distinct parts—well, six, if you count the office area. This is the main equipment bay, and I’ll show you through the paint booth, the small tool cages, the fab shop, the cylinder/hydraulics shop, and then we’ll end up in the office." 

Todd took his glasses off and wiped them dry with his undershirt. "Quiet here today." 

"Yeah," Fred said. "The guys all got pulled off to go work on the jobs, except for Jose. Jose is our preventive maintenance guy—he’s over there under the hood of that crew truck."

Fred was happy to give Todd a tour. He had been shop foreman for two and half years before his sudden promotion three weeks ago, and he knew the shop inside and out. He walked Todd through the shop, stopping to explain each major tool and workstation. Todd asked question after question, and Fred began to wonder if it was the same quiet man that sat silently through management meetings. When they finally made it into the office, Fred invited Todd to a coke from the minifridge and ushered him into his office. 

"So! You had more than just a few questions!" Fred chuckled. "But I’m guessing you still have a few more."

Just then Fred’s phone rang. It was Charles. "Hold on," Fred said to Todd. "I gotta grab this."

He answered the phone. "Hey Charles, what’s up?" 

"Well Boss, I got bad news. It’s not just the hydraulics, it’s also the screws. Bob here is screamin’ like a fool but we don’t have the parts and we don’t have the tool. I’m thinkin’ we’ll have to pull it back up to the shop—we gotta get under her, can’t get it from up top."

Fred sighed. "Ok, tell them to use the other one. I’ll call Bonzo and get the Cat 330 out there so they still have two machines while we fix the Volvo."

"They won’t be happy. The Volvo cab has AC. Sad and sweaty men." Charles replied.

"It’s April, it’s 55 degrees, and raining! Why do they care about AC?!?" Fred exploded. "Tell them I’m getting them the Cat 330 and to stop whining."

"One day of rain does not a cool summer make," Charles responded, "but relay your message I shall."

Fred grimaced and put down the phone. "Sorry, Todd. We gotta pull that excavator in from the Interstate project—the same one Bill was carrying on about in this morning’s meeting." Fred grabbed a stack of post-it notes from his desk, scribbled a note to call Bonzo, and stuck it in the middle of his monitor so he wouldn’t forget. "But what questions did you have?"

Todd pushed away some of the papers on desk to clear a spot for his Moleskine and opened it to the ribbon. "Well, there were a few things that you, Bill and Jimmy were discussing earlier that I don’t quite understand. I figured I’d ask you instead of just assume."

"Sure," said Fred. "Go for it."

"The first thing was the question I asked you on the way over to the shop—who decides what equipment goes out to the job. But my follow-up question to that is a normal situation who decides if a rental would be the better choice?"

When Fred had suggested that they replace the aging Volvo with a reliable and newer rental piece, Jimmy had shot it down. "We’re going to have half of Seattle driving by this job. I want _our _logo out there!" 

"It used to be dispatch that did that, but Bonzo said it was too confusing to keep track of, so he’s been having the supers do it. Some of the supers actually have the project engineer do it if they have one on the job. Bonzo lets them know if we have any of our pieces available, and if we don’t, he tells them to get a rental."

"I see," said Todd. "How many pieces do we have on rent right now?" 

"I have no idea!" Fred shook his head. "Too many, is all I know. I don’t think Neil ever knew even when the old dispatcher was managing it. Bonzo is right—it was a lot to keep track of."

"Got it. Sounds like you need to know that number." Todd looked down at his notebook again, and Fred felt a flush creep up his neck.

"Another question: You told Bill that you had another piece on ‘standby’ down at the Interstate job just in case the Volvo went down. Did he ask for that piece or had you sent it out there?"

"I sent it out there. The Volvo has been causing more and more problems, and I know how important deep sewer line is." Todd had sent it out last week, right after it had returned. 

"Bill said that ‘it was busy doing other things’ and couldn’t be used for the sewer. If it was an extra, how was it possible that it was being used?" Todd looked up from his notebook.

"I don’t know!" Fred pounded the desk with his fist. "If they needed another machine out there, I would have sent them another machine! We had another 330 sitting in the yard!"

Todd continued with his questions. "Bill said that the main problem is that it keeps breaking, and it isn’t reliable. Is that true?"

Fred felt the flush deepen. "I don’t know if it’s _true!_ Compared to what? I knew it was an unreliable piece, I told them to get a rental out there, but since we weren’t allowed to, I got another unreliable piece and stuck it on the job at the same time. I’m sick of this—old machines are going to break down!

Todd looked up. "I’m not blaming you. I’m genuinely wondering. The meeting this morning was so charged that I wasn’t sure what was true or not. There’s something that’s odd about all this. You’re convinced that the problem lies with Bill’s team, and Bill is convinced that the problem lies with your team. It seems like only one of you can be right."

There was a brief silence, and Todd spun his mechanical pencil through his fingers and looked up at the ceiling. "How many hours are there in a week?"

Fred was taken off-guard by the odd question. "Uh…" he pulled out his phone and switched to the calculator. "One hundred sixty eight."

"Ok, hmmm. We normally work 40-hour weeks, right?" 

"Yeah…" 

"How many machines do we own?" 

Fred was bewildered with the questions. "Counting just the big pieces and the crew trucks, and not counting all the small tools? I guess it’s around 400. More if you count the trailers as separate pieces of equipment."

"No, just the kind that actually works on the jobs. I think we can disregard the vehicles and on-road dump trucks for now." Todd said.

"Ok, hmm, I think it’s about 250 then. I can get you an exact number if I fire up my computer."

"No, no need for now," Todd replied. "So if there’s 40 hours a week, and 250 pieces, how many hours do we have total?"

Fred grabbed the calculator again. "10,000 per week. But I really don’t see where you’re going with this."

Todd’s phone buzzed, and he glanced at it. "Hey, I’ve got to run to the IT meeting. But listen—could you shoot me an email with the number of hours of working time, the number of hours of available time, the number of hours of down time, say for the last four weeks. Can you do that for me?" He got up and moved toward the door.

"Uh, sure, I guess I have that info somewhere." Fred said.

Todd nodded from the doorway, and gave a little wave. "I bet we’ll figure this out, Fred."

Fred shook his head, still not sure what to think of Todd, and turned to his computer. He saw the note to call Bonzo and shook his head. Guess I’ll have to get to Todd’s numbers later, he thought, picked up his phone, then stood up and put it in his pocket. Better just to walk over there and tell Bonzo in person.



## Appendix

The 5 ideals of a world-class equipment program

1. Know your costs

* Equipment revenue


2. Be proactive

* Utilization predicts ownership recovery

* Reliability predicts operating costs

* Buy what you burn


3. Standardize the work

* Build a work order system (color coding system)

* Ensure work is ready to be worked on


4. Build a team

* The hexagon


5. The customer comes first

* Estimating the jobs

* Uptime: Utilization only matters on the critical path
